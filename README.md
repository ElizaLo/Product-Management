## Best way to write a cover letter

- The Muse has some [“standout” examples](https://www.themuse.com/advice/31-attentiongrabbing-cover-letter-examples) that I would not use but you can start to see what grabs attention.

## Best advice on how to prepare for questions

- **_Be ready to talk about your favorite physical/digital product_** for yourself or for other people and do a proper “product tear-down”. Use the **[‘CIRCLES’ method](https://www.impactinterview.com/2016/08/circles-method-product-design-framework/) from Lewis Lin**, by far the most useful mental model.
- **Know the “SAR” (or STAR or SPAR or similar) structure and the “pyramid principle”** for organising your thoughts and answers. S, T, P, A, R refer to situation, task (or problem), action, result. Basically: some context, what was the problem, what did you do about it, and what happened? The **[pyramid principle](https://www.amazon.com/Minto-Pyramid-Principle-Writing-Thinking/dp/0960191038) developed by Barbara Minto**, a consultant, refers to grouping your answers into themes that are easier to digest.

### Also

- **Stock options:** If you’re in the US, working for a startup, you need to know about how companies are funded and how stock options work. That’s tricky territory not easy to explain in a summary other than to say “get clued up about finance because it’s your money and future we’re talking about.” Regardless of gender, ignorance is not cool. If you’re curious about the employer perspective on stock options for employees, I recommend Fred Wilson’s [MBA Mondays](http://avc.com/archive/#mba_mondays_archive) posts from back in 2010, particularly the ones on [“How Much?”](http://avc.com/2010/11/employee-equity-how-much/), [Vesting](http://avc.com/2010/11/employee-equity-vesting/), [Restricted Stock and RSUs](http://avc.com/2010/11/employee-equity-restricted-stock-and-rsus/) and [Options](http://avc.com/2010/10/employee-equity-options/).
- **For all other negotiations (money, time, flexibility):** I found that [Josh Doody](http://www.joshdoody.com/) had some helpful advice for how to think about negotiations. His newsletters are informative but you can [read his book too](https://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Salary-Negotiation-step-step/dp/0692568689).
- **For women in particular**, Anna Marie Clifton wrote a long post about how [she negotiated for an additional $15,000 at Yammer](https://medium.com/we-are-yammer/how-i-negotiated-for-an-additional-15-000-at-yammer-2d3c137623ec). [Silence](https://www.fastcompany.com/3049676/a-womans-most-powerful-salary-negotiation-tool-silence) can be a great ally in negotiations, and it’s useful to learn how to wield it.

## Advice for someone interested in getting into Product Management:

- **Talk to other Product Managers:** It's valuable to hear a first hand perspective -- what they enjoy, the biggest challenges, etc.
- **Ask yourself why:** It's important to do some introspection on your motivations for being a Product Manager and why you believe the role is the right one for you.
- **Mentorship is key:** When evaluating job opportunities, take into consideration the expected level of mentorship and guidance you can receive from an experienced Product Manager at the company.

## The top qualities interviewers look for in Product Manager candidates:

- **Passionate:** Does the candidate truly care about the users and the problems they are trying to solve? Candidates who are excited and energized about solving hard problems are going to be more successful.
- **Problem Solver:** A skilled problem solver is comfortable taking a large problem and breaking it down into smaller ones.
- **Strong Communicator:** A Product Manager has many audiences -- it's critical to know how and what to communicate depending on who you are talking to.
- **Self-Starter:** A successful Product Manager takes initiative -- one who not only identifies problems but takes the next step of trying to solve it. A Product Manager's role is filled with ambiguity, and it's important for individuals to have the mindset to just figure things out.

## Common types of questions you may get in a Product Manager interview:

- **Behavior Questions:** These are extremely common and intended to assess your skills as a Product Manager based on your prior experiences and background. Know your resume really well so you can speak to any part of it. It's also a good idea to be prepared with a few projects or products you worked on that you are most comfortable talking about.
- **Case Study Questions:** These can take different forms but are usually Strategy, Design, or Technical or some combination of the three. Practicing example case questions will prepare you to be more comfortable and confident answering these types of open-ended questions. Check out Lessons 2 and 3 from this course to review case study interviews in more detail.

## Some tips on how to stand out in a Product Manager interview:

- **Use the STAR:** When answering a behavioral question, such as describing a problem you solved, consider the STAR Method to structure your answer:
  - **S**ituation : Provide context for the problem
  - **T**ask : Explain what needed to be done
  - **A**ction: Describe specifically what you did
  - **R**esults: Explain the ultimate outcome
- **Remember to demonstrate learnings:** Often, more important than the ultimate outcome is what you learned along the way that helped you grow as a Product Manager. Make sure to highlight this when discussing your experiences.
- **Always break down the problem:** Candidates who provide some clarity and structure to open-ended questions will stand out.
- **Above and beyond:** It's not always practical or appropriate, but to really stand out, consider creating a product related proposal or project that is beneficial to the company and provide this as part of the interview process.
